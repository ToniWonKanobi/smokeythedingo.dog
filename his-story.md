We found Smokey in the Fall of 2009

I had just started school, and Allison was working locally. We thought it would be good to have a dog in the house

Little did we know that he would change our lives forever

![😜][2]

He makes everything more fun. Going to the store, going on trips, exploring nature---it's better when we're together

![⚫⚪][3]

The quite times are *special*. I love just sitting with him while he sleeps

![✌️][4]

He always finds a good spot to lay

![😴][5]

He is such a character. It has been so fun discovering what a personality he has

![👃🏿][6]

He loves to sniff the air wherever he goes

![🌿][7]

He soaks it all in

![🚶🏿‍♂️🐕][8]

Daily walks are a must

![🏔️][9]

There's nothing better than exploring our favorite place with him

![👋🏿][10]

He's always ready for whatever's next 🤠
